# Architecture Roadmap

This document outlines the architectural improvements and future enhancements planned for bee-trace.

## üéØ Completed Improvements (Loose Coupling & High Cohesion)

### ‚úÖ Trait-based Abstractions
- **Event Formatting**: Separated `Formattable` trait from concrete `TableFormatter`
- **Builder Pattern**: Common `SecurityEventBuilder` and `SecurityEventData` traits
- **Output Strategy**: `OutputStrategy` trait supporting multiple formats (JSON, CSV, PlainText)

### ‚úÖ Configuration System
- **Configurable Security Rules**: Moved hardcoded patterns to `SecurityConfig`
- **File-based Configuration**: `FileBasedConfigProvider` with JSON/TOML support
- **Runtime Configuration**: Dynamic security rule updates

### ‚úÖ Security Classification
- **Abstracted Classifier**: `SecurityEventClassifier` trait with configurable implementation
- **Severity Management**: `SeverityLevel` enum with risk scoring
- **Context-aware Classification**: Network, file, and memory event specific logic


## üöß Future Enhancements (TODO)

### 1. Dependency Injection System üîß
**Priority: High**

Implement dependency injection container for better testability and service management.

**Components:**
- `Container` with singleton and factory registration

- Mock service injection for unit tests

**Benefits:**
- Improved testability through dependency injection
- Centralized service management
- Easier mocking for unit tests
- Loose coupling between components

### 2. Plugin Architecture üîå
**Priority: High**

Implement a flexible plugin system for custom security rules and analyzers.

**Components:**
- `SecurityPlugin` trait for custom analysis logic
- `PluginManager` for plugin lifecycle management
- Built-in plugins:
  - Brute force detection
  - Privilege escalation detection
  - Anomalous network activity detection
- Plugin configuration and priority system

**Benefits:**
- Extensible security rules without core changes
- Community-contributed security analyzers
- Custom organization-specific detection logic

### 3. Event Filtering Pipeline üîÑ
**Priority: Medium**

Create a composable filtering system for event processing.

**Components:**
- `EventFilter` trait for filter implementations
- `FilterPipeline` for chaining multiple filters
- Built-in filters:
  - Process name filtering
  - Severity-based filtering
  - Rate limiting filters
  - Deduplication filters

**Benefits:**
- Reduced noise in security events
- Composable filtering logic
- Performance optimization through early filtering

### 3. Observer Pattern for Real-time Notifications üì°
**Priority: Medium**

Implement real-time event notification system.

**Components:**
- `SecurityEventObserver` trait
- `EventNotificationManager` for observer management
- Built-in observers:
  - SIEM integration observer
  - Webhook notification observer
  - Email alert observer
  - Slack/Discord integration observer

**Benefits:**
- Real-time security alerting
- Integration with external systems
- Customizable notification strategies

### 4. Factory Pattern for Event Processors üè≠
**Priority: Low**

Standardize event processor creation and configuration.

**Components:**
- `EventProcessorFactory` trait
- Processor registry system
- Configuration-driven processor selection
- Processor lifecycle management

**Benefits:**
- Standardized processor creation
- Dynamic processor selection
- Easier testing and mocking

### 5. Advanced Monitoring Features üìä
**Priority: Medium**

Enhanced monitoring and metrics collection.

**Components:**
- Metrics collection framework
- Performance monitoring
- Health check endpoints
- Distributed tracing support

**Benefits:**
- Operational visibility
- Performance optimization insights
- Production monitoring capabilities

### 6. Stream Processing Architecture üåä
**Priority: Low**

Implement stream processing for high-throughput scenarios.

**Components:**
- Async event stream processing
- Backpressure handling
- Stream transformations
- Batch processing optimization

**Benefits:**
- High-performance event processing
- Scalable architecture
- Memory-efficient processing

## üìê Design Principles

### Loose Coupling Guidelines
- Depend on abstractions (traits), not concretions
- Use dependency injection for service resolution
- Minimize direct dependencies between modules
- Implement clear interface boundaries

### High Cohesion Guidelines
- Single responsibility per module/struct
- Related functionality grouped together
- Clear separation of concerns
- Domain-driven design principles

### Testability Requirements
- All dependencies injectable
- Mock implementations available
