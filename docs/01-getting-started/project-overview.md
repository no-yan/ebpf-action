# bee-trace Project Overview

## What is bee-trace?

bee-trace is an eBPF-based security monitoring tool designed to detect and report potential security threats in real-time. Built with Rust using the Aya framework, it provides comprehensive monitoring of file access, network connections, and memory operations with minimal system overhead.

## Key Features

### üîí Security Monitoring
- **File Access Monitoring**: Detects access to sensitive files (SSH keys, credentials, certificates)
- **Network Connection Tracking**: Monitors TCP/UDP connections with blocking capabilities
- **Memory Access Detection**: Tracks inter-process memory access and environment variable access
- **Real-time Event Processing**: Low-latency security event classification and reporting

### üèóÔ∏è Modern Architecture
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimal dependencies between components
- **High Cohesion**: Single responsibility per module
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Deep Modules**: Complex eBPF operations hidden behind simple interfaces

### ‚ö° Performance
- **Low Overhead**: <5% CPU impact under normal workload
- **Memory Efficient**: <100MB memory usage for all probe types
- **Kernel-space Filtering**: Efficient event processing with minimal userspace overhead
- **Scalable Design**: Zero event loss under 1000 events/second

## Use Cases

### CI/CD Security Monitoring
- Monitor GitHub Actions workflows for suspicious activity
- Detect unauthorized access to secrets and credentials
- Track network connections to external services
- Identify potential supply chain attacks

### Development Environment Security
- Monitor file access patterns during builds
- Detect credential leakage in development workflows
- Track memory access between processes
- Identify unusual network activity

### Container Security
- Monitor containerized applications for security events
- Track file and network access in isolated environments
- Detect escape attempts and privilege escalation
- Real-time security event reporting

## How It Works

### eBPF Integration
bee-trace uses eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) programs that run in kernel space to:

1. **Attach to System Events**: Monitors system calls and tracepoints
2. **Filter Events**: Applies filtering logic in kernel space for efficiency
3. **Collect Data**: Gathers relevant security event information
4. **Stream to Userspace**: Sends events via perf buffers for processing
