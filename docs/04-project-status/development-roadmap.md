# bee-trace Development Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines a phased development approach for bee-trace, prioritizing **foundation, security, and reliability** before feature expansion. Each phase has clear validation gates to ensure quality and security.

## Development Philosophy

### Why Phased Approach?

1. **Security-First**: As a security monitoring tool running with elevated privileges, we must audit ourselves first
2. **Foundation-First**: Core eBPF functionality must be rock-solid before adding features  
3. **Performance-Critical**: eBPF programs can cause kernel panics or severe performance degradation
4. **Raspberry Pi Development**: Local development platform requirements drive initial priorities

### Validation Gates

Each phase requires **complete validation** before proceeding to the next phase:
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Security review passed  
- ✅ Performance benchmarks within acceptable limits
- ✅ Test coverage targets achieved

## Phase 1: Foundation & Critical Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Objective**: Establish reliable core functionality on Raspberry Pi platform

### 1.1 Raspberry Pi Basic Operation Verification
**Goal**: Confirm all probe types work correctly on target platform

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `file_monitor` probe loads and detects file access events
- [ ] `network` probe loads and captures network connections  
- [ ] `memory` probe loads and detects memory access events
- [ ] All probes can be loaded simultaneously without conflicts
- [ ] Clean shutdown without kernel warnings/errors

**Validation Method**: Manual testing with known trigger scenarios

### 1.2 Critical Bug Fix: ProcessMemoryEvent target_comm
**Goal**: Fix empty target_comm field that breaks process correlation

**Root Cause**: Missing process name mapping in eBPF program
**Solution**: 
- Add `sched_process_exec` tracepoint to capture PID→command mapping
- Store mapping in eBPF hashmap  
- Lookup target process name during memory access events

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `target_comm` field populated correctly in ProcessMemoryEvent
- [ ] Memory access events show both source and target process names
- [ ] Map cleanup handles process exit scenarios

### 1.3 Raspberry Pi Kernel Requirements Verification  
**Goal**: Document and verify minimum kernel configuration

**Required Kernel Features**:
```
CONFIG_BPF=y
CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y  
CONFIG_BPF_JIT=y
CONFIG_HAVE_EBPF_JIT=y
CONFIG_BPF_EVENTS=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF_MODULES=y
CONFIG_KPROBES=y
CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS=y
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Kernel configuration verification script created
- [ ] Documentation of minimum kernel version requirements
- [ ] Fallback behavior for missing features defined
- [ ] Clear error messages for unsupported configurations

### 1.4 Security Audit of bee-trace Itself
**Goal**: Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in our tool

**Security Review Areas**:
- **Privilege Escalation**: Verify proper privilege dropping after eBPF load
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs (config files, CLI args)  
- **Buffer Safety**: Review all string handling and memory operations
- **Race Conditions**: Analyze concurrent access to eBPF maps
- **Information Disclosure**: Ensure no sensitive data leakage in logs/output

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Static analysis (clippy, cargo audit) passes
- [ ] Memory safety review completed (no unsafe code without justification)
- [ ] Input validation implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] Privilege boundaries clearly defined and enforced
- [ ] Security test cases added to test suite

### 1.5 Basic Error Handling
**Goal**: Graceful failure handling for common scenarios

**Error Scenarios**:
- eBPF program load failure (kernel version, missing features)
- Insufficient privileges (CAP_BPF, root required)
- Resource exhaustion (memory, file descriptors)
- Invalid configuration parameters

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Clear, actionable error messages for each failure mode
- [ ] Graceful cleanup on all error paths
- [ ] No panics or crashes under error conditions  
- [ ] Exit codes follow standard conventions
- [ ] Fallback modes for partial functionality

## Phase 2: Reliability & Performance (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Objective**: Ensure production-ready reliability and performance

### 2.1 Comprehensive Testing Strategy
**Goal**: Achieve high confidence through systematic testing

**Test Categories**:
- **Unit Tests**: Event parsing, filtering logic, configuration handling
- **Integration Tests**: eBPF program loading, event collection end-to-end
- **Security Tests**: Privilege escalation, input fuzzing, DoS resistance  
- **Load Tests**: High-frequency event scenarios, memory usage under load
- **Compatibility Tests**: Multiple kernel versions, architecture variants

**Coverage Targets**:
- [ ] >90% line coverage for userspace code
- [ ] >80% branch coverage for critical paths
- [ ] All error paths tested
- [ ] All probe types covered in integration tests

### 2.2 Performance Impact Assessment
**Goal**: Quantify system impact and establish acceptable limits

**Metrics to Measure**:
- **CPU Overhead**: Baseline vs. monitoring active (per probe type)
- **Memory Usage**: Userspace and kernel memory consumption  
- **Latency Impact**: System call latency increase
- **False Positive Rate**: Benign events incorrectly flagged
- **Event Loss Rate**: Events dropped under high load

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] CPU overhead <5% under normal workload
- [ ] Memory usage <100MB for all probe types active
- [ ] Latency increase <10% for monitored operations
- [ ] False positive rate <1% for common scenarios
- [ ] Zero event loss under 1000 events/second load

### 2.3 Operational Features Enhancement

**Security Requirements**:
- Run as non-root user where possible
- Minimal capabilities (`CAP_BPF`, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` only if required)
- Read-only filesystem mounts
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, file descriptors)

**Required Mounts** (read-only):
```
/proc:/host/proc:ro
/sys:/host/sys:ro  
/dev:/host/dev:ro (for eBPF device access)
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Container runs with minimal privileges
- [ ] All monitoring functions work in containerized environment
- [ ] Security scanner passes (no high/critical vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Resource usage contained within defined limits
- [ ] Documentation for secure deployment

### 3.2 CI/CD Integration  
**Goal**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline

**GitHub Actions Workflow**:

- Security scanning (container and dependency scanning)
- Integration tests with actual eBPF programs
- Performance regression testing
- Automated security event validation

**Acceptance Criteria**:

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Kernel Compatibility**: eBPF features vary across kernel versions
   - **Mitigation**: Feature detection, graceful degradation, extensive testing

2. **Performance Impact**: eBPF programs can severely impact system performance  
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive benchmarking, resource limits, opt-out mechanisms

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Tool runs with elevated privileges
   - **Mitigation**: Security-first development, regular audits, minimal privileges

4. **False Positives**: Incorrect alerts reduce tool effectiveness
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing with real workloads, tunable sensitivity

### Success Metrics

- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime in production environments
- **Performance**: <5% system overhead under normal load  
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities in security reviews
- **Usability**: Documentation enables successful deployment by new users
- **Maintenance**: Clear error messages reduce support burden by 80%

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Development Environment
- Rust toolchain (stable + nightly with rust-src)

### Validation Requirements  
- Each phase requires approval before proceeding
- Security review mandatory for Phases 1, 2, and 3
- Performance benchmarks must meet targets
- Test coverage must meet minimum thresholds

### Timeline Considerations
- Phase 1: Foundation-critical, blocks all other work
- Phase 2: Production-readiness, required for any deployment
- Phase 3: Deployment enablement, required for CI/CD
- Phase 4: Feature enhancement, can be deprioritized

This roadmap ensures a **secure, reliable, and performant** security monitoring tool before adding convenience features.
